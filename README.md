## ✅ Problem Statement

**Track: Hospitality & Travel**  
Reimagine hotel and travel experiences with AI-powered voice interactions. Our submission touches all key ideas of the theme:

1. **Room-Service Ranger**: Voice-powered ordering of food, towels, and requests like late check-out.  
2. **Local Explorer**: Guests ask for sightseeing, dining, and personalized recommendations synced to Travai logic.  
3. **Creative Add-On**: Combines both hotel & travel voice agents into one seamless assistant — no app, no buttons, just pure conversation.
